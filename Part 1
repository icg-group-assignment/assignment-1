Description: We decided to come up with a website. This will 
have Staff members (Manager and employees), Customers and Products.
For an employee to log into the website he/she need to select on 
Employee first and than enter his/her name and employee ID number.
They will use this platform help customers by answering their 
questions and refer them to the manager if they can't give details
on what the customer is asking. For a manager to log into the website 
he/she needs to click on manager and enter his/her name as it appears 
on work ID and their date of birth. They will use this platform to do 
advertisements and see customers demand.They can also use it to tell 
customers which products are out of stock and the ones that are available. 
Managers will also use it meetings with their customers to hear from them 
eye-eye. Customers will log in to thisplatform by just clicking on 
customer and enter their customer's card number. They'll use it for 
purchasing and making their demands. Remember this website us for all
